===============

This is a tutorial on how to setup an [Openshift Origin](https://github.com/openshift/origin) cluster on [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com). It is intended for those who are familiar 
with Docker and Kubernetes and would like to bring up an OpenShift cluster from scratch.

The goal is to setup a hypothetical platform-as-a-service for self-hosted apps, with a running continuous deployment pipeline (GitLab).
